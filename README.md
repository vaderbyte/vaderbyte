### About Me
My Name is [Aayush Nigam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayush-nigam/) and I'm a novice data analyst who has completed the [certification](https://coursera.org/share/effa60f4de909ad4448c6cdd15d1eadd) from IBM in Data Analytics and Vizualization. I believe that data analytics is the industrial revolution and can be a cause for good in the world. It's up to humans like you and me to guide that future.
